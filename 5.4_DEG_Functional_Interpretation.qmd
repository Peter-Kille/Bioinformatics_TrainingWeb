# Workshop Overview

# Key Statistical Concepts

The workshop will use tools that exploit statistical approaches to identify differential expressed genes (DEGs) and subsequently identify the biological pathways or processes that are over represented (some time refereed to as enriched) within the DEGs. You will not need to derive the mathematical formula underpinning these concepts or deploy the algorithums from first principles since the software you will use does this for you but it is worth knowing the background. There is an excellent academic from Stanford University, Prof Josh Starmer, who runs a youtube channel called [StatQuest](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtYLUTtgS3k1Fg4y5tAhLbw) this deal with a large range of biological stats and has some great annotations to explain them, I am going to suggest you watch two of his videos to orientate you about the key statistical concepts for this session:

## Gene Enrichment Analysis with David

\[David - Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery\] (https://david.ncifcrf.gov/) was the tool to use for gene enrichment from 2005 - 2016 but the database it hosted became out of date due to a break in the research groups funding. From 2016 (gprofiler)\[https://biit.cs.ut.ee/gprofiler/gost\] and (stringdb)\[https://string-db.org/\] have been prefered because they have been kept upto date. However, DAVID was refunded and a 2021 update means it is back to being maintained. Although there will not be time to explore it in our workshop the following workshop and video is there to support anyone wanting to explore its functionality.

## 1. Start analysis and upload you data

Select ***\< start analysis \>***

Paste in you gene list (1) in box (A) and, select identifier (2), and identify as a Gene List (3). Select your species (2a) . In more nuanced analysis you may wish to define your own background - this is useful when working with non-model organisms or if your starting population does not represent the entire genome.

![DAVID Upload](images/david_upload.png) ***DAVID Upload***

now select ***\< Submit List \>***

## 2. Generate Functional Analysis of gene list

If you have used a non-regulate gene identifier or it does not recognize the identifier type you have used it may ask you to convert the identifiers - check the programs suggestion - it is usually good but you should check.

Select ***\< Functional Annotation Tool \>***

You will now be give a annotation summary as shown below:

![Annotation Summary](images/david_annotation_summary.png) ***Annotation Summary***

You will see a range of categories for which the functional annotation has been performed. The analysis told has not only cross referenced the gene list against a range of functional databases it has also analysed the gene co-appearance in citations (Literature), links to disease (Disease) and Interactions agonist other linkages.

## 3. Review Gene Ontology Enrichment

Let us consider the functional enrichment using (Gene Ontology)\[http://geneontology.org/\]. Gene Ontology categorizes gene products using three distinct characteristics - Molecular Function (biochemistry of the product), Cellular Component (where it appears in the cell), and the Biological Processes - see more about these classification by reviewing the (Gene Ontology Overview documentation)\[http://geneontology.org/docs/ontology-documentation/\]. Although ontologies are hierarchical, they are not a simple classification system, they not only allow for gene products to be involved with multiple processes the relationship between elements in the hierarchy are closely defined. The ontology also allows for classification to be as specific or detailed as knowledge allows ie if a protein is a transporter but what it transports is not known it will be defined by a mid-level term 'transporter' but if it is known to transport Zn it will be classified at a 'Zinc transport' as well as a 'transporter'. Enrichment analysis uses fisher exact test (see about) to calculate the enrichment at each of these 'levels' - although I usually choose to look at the integrated data summarized under the 'GOTERM\_\[BP/CC/MF\]\_DIRECT'.

click on the + next too the ***\< Gene_Ontology \>*** category

Select ***\< Chart \>*** right of the GOTERM_BP_DIRECT

![BP Enrichment](images/David_BP_enrichment.png) ***BP Enrichment***

Note the P-value and benjamini correct p-value displaying the like hood that those specific Go terms are represented by random - i.e. lost the P-value the less likely the representation of the term is a random select , therefore the more likely the term is enriched.

To see the list of gene involved in for instance 'positive regulation of osteoblast differentiation' click on the blue bar under the 'Genes' column.

This is the list you will see:

![positive regulation of osteoblast differentiation](images/osteoblast_differentiation.png) ***positive regulation of osteoblast differentiation***

Now review enrichment for Cell Component and Molecular Function.

## 4. Pathway analysis

click on the + next too the ***\< Pathways \>*** category

![Pathway Options](images/David_pathways.png) ***Pathway Options***

Select ***\< Chart \>*** right of the KEGG

![KEGG Enrichment](images/Kegg_enrichment.png) ***KEGG Enrichment***

You will see a list of enriched pathways - Note the P-value and benjamini correct p-value displaying the like hood that those specific pathways are represented by random - i.e. lost the P-value the less likely the representation of the pathway is a random select, therefore the more likely the pathways is enriched.

click on the ***\< TNF Signalling Pathway \>***\_ in the term column

This will display the pathway with the terms that are present in the list shown with red stars or highlight by redtext below the figure.

![TNF Signalling Pathway](images/TNF.png) ***TNF Signalling Pathway***

Explore some more pathways

## 5. Functional Annotation Clustering

DAVID attempts to summarise enrichment between categorization systems using a tool it terms - Functional annotation clustering. If you select this for you current data set. you will be provided with the following clusters:

![Functional Annotation Clustering](images/Functional_Annotation_Clustering.png) ***Functional Annotation Clustering***

Each cluster is assigned an enrichment score under which 'terms' that are enriched under different classification systems are displayed grouped together. Each 'grouping' is given a 'Enrichment Score' the larger the enrichment score the higher the score the more likely that cluster is being enriched. Note that the is a 'Classification Stringency' pull down menu that allows you to define the strength of associated of the term being grouped together.

For annotation Cluster 6 (which contains lots of Metallothionein/cadimum associated terms) there is a small green and black box - after the Enrichment Score and the 'G' - click on this box. This brings up a cluster matrix showing the gene gene products on the Y-axis and the classification 'vlasses' on the X-axis.

# 4.2C gPofiler

1.  Load you DEG list

Paste you DEG list into the box and click on ***\< Run query \>*** (I suggest you select Benjamin-Hochberg FDR under Advanced options)

![gprofiler upload data](images/gprofiler_upload.png) ***gprofiler upload data***

You may be asked if you wish to confirm gene identified - if you are accept the selected options.

2.  Review Enrichment

You will be presented with and enrichment summary.

![Enrichment Summary](images/Enrichment_summary.png) ***Enrichment Summary***

Here the y-axis is -log10(adjPValue) - so the larger the number the more improbably the functional representation is there by random. The size of the symbols represent the number of genes in each category.

Now select ***\< Detailed Results \>*** this is a tab that is displayed about halfway down the page

![gprofiler detailed results](images/gprofiler_detailed_results.png) ***gprofiler detailed results***

Note:

Adjusted p-value if give next to each term

Top of the detailed results page there is 'CSV' option to download the data into a spreadsheet format.

3.  Consider the Transcription Factor enrichment.

Gene regulation is at the heart of DEGs - co-regulated gene should should have direct or indirect regulatory network moderated through conserved transcription factor binding sites.

# 4.3 Semantic similarity with Revigo

Revigo can take long lists of Gene Ontology terms and summarize them by removing redundant GO terms using semantic similarity. The input you need is a list of GO terms in the format `GO:[NUMBER]` a tab and the associated p-value.

## 1. Export GO terms and P-values

### 1A. gprofiler

Under the detailed results menu there is a `CSV` icon which when clicked can be used to export your enriched terms as a CSV which can then be imported into excel. You can use the associated setting button (the cog symbol next toi the CSV) to select only GO terms to export for this exercise.

![gprofiler export](images/gprofiler_export.png) ***gprofiler export***

You will then need to copy column C and D into Revigo

### 1B. DAVID

After you have completed the functional analysis select ***\< Gene_ontology \> GOTERM_BP_DIRECT \> Chart \>***

now Select ***\< Download File \>***

![DAVID Go Dowbload](images/david_go_download.png) ***DAVID Go Download***

This will either display the enrichment table into the browser window or ask for a save location depending on your browser settings. If you are not asked for a save location right hand click the displayed table and select `Save as` and save to a appropriate location as a text file. This text file can be opened/imported into excel. You will file the GO term is concatenated with the GO description in Column B. To split this insert a blank column after column B, then select column B and select menu option ***\< Data \> Test to columns \>***. Select ***\< Delimited \> Next \>***\_ and use the radio button to select ***other*** and add a ***\~***\_ to the box directly to the right of this option. Now click ***\< Next and Finish \>***. You will see the GO term in now in Column B and the P-value in column F. Select these columns and paste them into Revigo.

You should now repeat this process for Molecular Function and Cell Component Terms.When all the data is merged you can paste the GO term and P value into Revigo.

## 2. Revigo data entry

Enter GO terms and P-values into Revigo - they should be in format

```         
Term    PValue
GO:0045892  7.75E-06
GO:0006694  3.29E-04
```

Leave the default settings and select ***\< Start Revigo \>***

## 3. Review Revigo Results

For each GO term category Revigo will generate a Scatterplot, Table, 3D scatter plot, interactive Graph and Tree Map. ***Note: at the bottom of each plot there are export options for R and other formats*** \_.

The most intuitive format is are the Tree Maps (see below) whilst the Scatterplot output table, which include terms like 'Frequency and Uniqueness' can be used to create networks in Cytoscape.
