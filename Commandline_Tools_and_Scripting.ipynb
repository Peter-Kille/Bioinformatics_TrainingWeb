        "\n",
        "There are many commands available for reading text files on Linux/Unix. These are useful when you want to look at the contents of a file, but do not edit them. Among the most common of these commands are cat, more, less, head and tail.\n",
        "\n",
        "cat can be used for concatenating files and reading files into other programs; it is a very useful facility. However, cat streams the entire contents of a file to your terminal and is thus not that useful for reading long files as the text streams past too quickly to read.\n",
        "\n",
        "more and less are commands that show the contents of a file one page at a time. less has more functionality than more. With both more and less, you can use the space bar to scroll down the page, and typing the letter q causes the program to quit -- returning you to your command line prompt.\n",
        "\n",
        "head and tail show the beginning and end 10 lines of a document. You can use the argument -n \\[number\\] to change the number of lines displayed.\n",
        "\n",
        "Once you are reading a document with more or less, typing a forward slash / will start a prompt at the bottom of the page, and you can then type in text that is searched for below the point in the document you were at. Typing in a ? also searches for a text string you enter, but it searches in the document above the point you were at. Hitting the n key during a search looks for the next instance of that text in the file.\n",
        "\n",
        "With less (but not more), you can use the arrow keys to scroll up and down the page, and the b key to move back up the document if you wish to.\n",

        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "You can also use flexible search terms, known as regular expressions, in your grep searches. You have already used glob pattern expressions in this practical, but regular expressions are somewhat different and more powerful. For example, when you listed all files with the pattern tes*embl* you were using a glob pattern comprising explicit characters (e.g. tes) and special symbols (\\* meaning any character or characters). The equivalent in grep would be \"tes.*embl.*\" where the period signifies any single character and the \\* signifies any number of repeats.\n",
        "\n",
        "Therefore to get from a shell glob pattern to a regular expression replace each \\* with .\\* and each ? with . . You also need to enclose the expression in quotes to tell the shell not to try and interpret it as a glob.\n",
        "\n",
        "Unmodified glob patterns will be accepted by grep but will not work as intended. For example the pattern tes\\* in grep means te followed by any number of s characters in sequence (te, tes, tess, tesss, ...). The question mark now signifies optionality -- so tes? means te followed by zero or one s character (te, tes). Regular expressions are found in several places other than grep, most notably in the Perl scripting language. The full syntax is extensive and powerful but is beyond the scope of this course, so back to the command itself...\n",
        "\n",
        "grep requires a regular expression as input, and returns all the lines containing that pattern to you as output.\n",
        "\n",
        "grep is especially useful in combination with pipes as you can filter the results of other commands.\n",
        "\n",
        "For example, perhaps you only want to see only the information in an EMBL file relating to the origin of the sequence, that is, the DE line. You do not need to search the file in an editor, you can just grep for lines beginning in DE, as in the next exercise.\n",

        "\n",
        "The second command in the exercise also returns lines in the file that have a letter D followed by a letter E, but only where DE is found at the beginning of a line. This is because the \\^ symbol means \"match at the beginning of a line\". The \\$ symbol can be used similarly to mean \"at the end of a line\". These are known as anchors. Passing the -x flag to grep tells it to automatically anchor both ends of the search pattern.\n",
        "\n",
        "What this anchoring does in the example above is return to you just the organism information in the embl file. This is because none of the other lines returned in the previous command started with DE, they just contained DE somewhere in them. This is an example where knowing how information is stored in an given file, along with a few basic Linux commands, allows you to retrieve information quickly.\n",

The above command streams the contents of all files matching the glob pattern \\*seqs.fasta through a search with grep looking for lines that start with the symbol \\> . The quotes around the pattern \\^\\> are necessary, as otherwise it is interpreted as a request for redirection of output to a file, rather than as a character to look for. As before, the \\^ symbol means \"match only at the beginning of the line\".\n",
        "\n",
        "The output of this grep search is sent to the wc command, with the -l indicating that you want to know the number of lines -- ie. the number of headers and by implication the number of sequences.\n",
        "\n",
        "An easier version of this shown as the second example uses the grep -c argument that return the number of matches found.\n",
        "\n",
        "So a synopsis of the command above is: Read through all files with names ending seqs.fasta and look for all the header lines in the combined output, then count up those lines that matched and return the number to screen.\n",
