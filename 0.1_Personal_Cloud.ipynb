        "\n",
        "High performance computing (HPC) systems are large, multi-processor, large RAM 'computers' that are installed in data centres. Usually users are provided with a login to a shared HPC system with strictly controlled access and defined quotas. To run your informatic tasks, you write a script that sends your job to a 'queuing' program which coordinates the processing requests of all the users on the system. In this way the system can support large numbers of users, but you need to wait for your place in the queue before your task can be performed. Although you can do the very lightest tasks - copy small files, rename etc. - without sending them to the queue, most tasks need to go through the queue. This can be very tedious when learning to code, as if your script creates an error you won't know until it has waited its turn in the queue.\n",
        "\n",
        "To avoid the queues we provide personal cloud systems to each person on the course, allowing them to interactively use the HPC system. To do this we create a container which has the equivalent of a 'virtual machine' (VM) in the cloud; we use a system called Kubernetes to create these container-based virtual machines. Each user has dedicated processors, RAM, storage and their own environment so they can interactively learn to use a Linux system. Because we are having to reserve a proportion of the server for each user we can only allocate a limited number of processors and RAM to each user - usually this is 8 processors and 16 Gb RAM, but check with your course organiser.\n",
        "\n",
        "Similar 'containers' can be accessed using [AWS cloud services](https://aws.amazon.com/health/genomics/) or through academic services such as [CLIMB](https://www.climb.ac.uk/). AWS cloud does provide some educational free cloud processing but when these free credits are over you would need to pay for processing and storage, and this can very quickly get expensive. CLIMB provides academic registration if you are supported by specific research council funding.\n",
