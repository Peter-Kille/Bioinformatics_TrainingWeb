# Mining Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO)

All research articles published in peer-reviewed journals must submit the data (raw or processed) to an accessible data archive - the most commonly used being NCBI GEO. Unfortunately the standards and types of data acceptable for submission to GEO have changed over the years from microarray datasets that were uploaded fully processed and ready to analyse - [Processed Datasets](#2.1D Processed dataset) to current practices where links are provided to the raw fastq file deposited within the Short Read Archive (SRA).  Below I have provided instructions of how to create gene lists from each data type provided by GEO (I am sure I would have missed one but hopefully the list cover the majority of the options).

# 2.1A SRA - Fastq and Annotation (Serise Matrix Files)

Provision of SRA and annotation files in teh forms of a 'Serise Matrix Files' requires you to download the data and create count file by mapping as described in [tutorial 5.1] (). Additionally you will need to reconfigure the annotation provided in the Serise Matrix Files into a metadata file format that can be used for SARTools (DESeq2) pipeline for DEG generation [tutorial 5.3]() 

# 2.1B Raw Count matrix (CSV/TSV) and Annotation (Serise Matrix Files)

Open the DEG TSV - you will have ID (Affymetrix), Gene Symbol, Description and Log2(fold Change) and Adjusted p-value. The Gene.symbol can have multiple symonyms for each gene - this can bias future analsyis. Copy/paste gene symbol column to rught hand column (so no other data is on right), and use ***\< Data \> Text to Columns \> Delimited \> Other \> '/' \> Finish \>***\_ to push secondary symbols into other columns.

# 2.1C Geo2R configured unprocessed raw counts and group metadata

Select un-processed series (should be number 2 - it will have icon ***\< Analyze with GEO2R \>*** at the end of the entry)

Click on ***\< Analyze with GEO2R \>***

Now Define groups by click clicking the ***\< Define Group pull \>*** down and create groups 'control' and 'Treatment' (enter group name and press enter). Click on each sample in list and associated it with one of your group (you can hold ctrl down to select multiple entry before associating them with the group).

![Select Groups to Compare](images/compare_groups_geo2R.png) ***Select Groups to compare***

4B. Customise the Option and Analyse

Select ***\< Options \>*** and customise as shown below:

![Geo2R Options](images/Geo2R_Options.png) ***Geo2R Options***

Select ***\< reanalyze \>***

Will will now see a Processing icon - this may take a minute or two.

5B. DEGs

You will now see a table and a series of Visualisations - review the visualisation taking note of what each are showing you.

Venn diagram showing GSE4567: Limma, Padj\<0.05 - 704 genes - this is the set we will use

Click on ***\< Explore and download, control vs treatment and Download Significant genes \>***

This will give you a Tsv you can open in excel

# 2.1D Processed dataset

Go to Geo DataSets: (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gds/)\[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gds/\]

![GEO_DataSet Search](images/GEO_DataSets.png) ***GEO_DataSet Search***

now select <Search>

2.  Refine search to only show 'DataSets' and 'Series'

Select ***\< DataSets and Series \>*** from the left hand menu.

![Refine to DataSets](images/DataSet_Selection.png) ***Refine to DataSets***

3A. Select procesed dataset (should be number 3 in list and have a heat map icon to the right)

Click on title ***\< Endothelial cell response to ultrafine particles \>*** to select DataSet

![Entry Page](images/GDS2565.png) ***Entry Page***

Take notes off all pertinent information about the experiment, including species and what microarray platform was used. In this case experiment was conducted on rats and analysed on an Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Array. Download any publication available. Also, if you are interested you could have a look at the cluster analysis on the right hand site. This will show you how the relationship of the expression profiles from each sample relative to each other. If the experiment was successful, all samples of a certain treatment should cluster together.

4A. Compare experiment samples

Click ***\<Compare 2 sets of sample\>***

Choose ***\<test e.g. One-tailed t-test (A \> B)\>***

Choose <significance level>\_ e.g. 0.001

Click on: Step 2: Select which Samples to put in Group A and Group B

![Select Groups to Comnpare](images/group_compare.png) ***Select Groups to compare***

Choose ***\< Query Group A vs B \>***

You should now see a list of the following DEGS

![DEG list](images/DEGs.png) ***DEG List***

5A. Download DEGs

You have \>100 DEGs but the page only displays the first 20. Before downloading DEGS change the items per page from 20 to 500.

![Items Per Page](images/Items_per_page.png) ***Items Per Page***

Select ***\< Download profile data \>***

and you will be prompted to save the profiling of the DEGs displayed as default file name ***\<profile_data.txt\>***

Save to appropriate location. If needed Select Page 2.... of the DEGS and repeat the download process.

Repeat this process for ***\<test e.g. One-tailed t-test (B \> A) significance level 0.001 \>***\_

6A. Open and Merge DEG lists in Excel

The DEG lists show the gene list with there relative expression level (normalised) and annotation for the genes involved (annotation shown in columns BG -\>). For Our next steps we will use the Gene symbol that is in Column BH.
